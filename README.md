## LBG algorithm
### Introdution
Linde–Buzo–Gray algorithm is a clustering algorithm similar to K-means. The most notable difference is that LBG split code-vector by adding or subtracting epsilon from already-existed code-vectors to increase the number of code-vectors. 

### Steps
1. Initialize 1 code vector $\theta $ as mean of all input data vectors.
2. While number of code vector < size_codebook:

	2.3 $$ r_4$$
